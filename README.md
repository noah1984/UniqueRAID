# UniqueRAID
This is a proof-of-concept that a unique variant of RAID is possible when data is dispersed and recovered in a specific manner, in an array of 7 drives or more (odd number of drives). It was my final project for a physics course at Bellevue College. The course was PHYS109, and the project was submitted March 8th, 2016. Read "Noah Allen - Comparison of Data Recovery Designs.docx" for more information.
